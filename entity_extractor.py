- For each entity, include any aliases or pronouns by which the entity is referenced.
- Include a spanish translation only for:
  * Traditional place names that have official or commonly used Spanish versions (e.g., London -> Londres, New York -> Nueva York)
  * Dates in standard format
  * Do NOT translate widely recognized names, technology hubs, company names, or branded terms (e.g., Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Times Square)
- Identify relevant dates as "Date" entities.
- Extract only Subject-Action-Object (SAO) relationships between entities (e.g., Person to Organization, Person to Location, Organization to Location, etc.).
- Output the result strictly as JSON, following the exact structure and formatting shown in the example.
- Do not provide any additional text, explanation, or commentaryâ€”only the JSON.
